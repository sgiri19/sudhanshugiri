### The Challenge
The legacy platform suffered from significant technical debt, slow load times, and a declining user retention rate. The goal was to modernize the entire stack while maintaining 100% uptime for existing enterprise clients.

### The Strategy
We adopted a multi-phase approach:
1. **Context over Control**: Empowered the engineering team to choose a modern Next.js architecture.
2. **User-Centric Redesign**: Leveraged analytics to identify and eliminate friction points in the core user journey.
3. **Phased Migration**: Used a strangler pattern to migrate features gradually without service interruption.

### Key Outcomes
- **40% Increase** in user retention within the first quarter.
- **25% Reduction** in churn rate.
- **60% Faster** page load times globally.
- **Improved NPS** from 12 to 45.

This project demonstrated the power of aligning technical excellence with business strategy to drive measurable impact.
