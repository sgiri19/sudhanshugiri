Invited to deliver an inaugural talk on leadership at St. Xavier's College Bombay (Mumbai), Field Marshal Manekshaw wasted no time in addressing the crux of the matter. He boldly proclaimed that the shortage of leadership was at the root of all shortages in India. He debunked the notion that leaders are solely born, pointing out India's prolific population growth, suggesting that if leadership were solely innate, shortages wouldn't persist.

"Give me a man with reasonable common sense and decency," he asserted, "and you can make a leader out of him."

4) **Moral and Physical Courage:**  Courage, both moral and physical, is the bedrock of leadership, enabling individuals to uphold principles and face adversity head-on.

5) **Loyalty:**  True leadership entails reciprocal loyalty, where leaders earn the trust and allegiance of their team through actions, not just words.
