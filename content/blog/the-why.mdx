What exactly does this mean? Is it just getting the final report card from the school or perhaps getting a college degree? But still the question remains is what does this really fetch?

Is the student who passed out with flying colors have the ability to deal the tough reality of this world? Or is she/he taught on how to face the setbacks the moment they face this reality.

Unfortunately, most of the parents are in illusion that if they are paying hefty fee for the education of their child at school and tuition, then they have excelled in parenting and it's those educational institutes duty to look after their child.

No!

This is not true at all!!

Actually its the parent who play a crucial role in molding their child's mentality. Let's keep this topic for some other day's conversation and get back to our first question.

### What is Education?

Well, it's pretty easier to define it but equally difficult to implement.

It is more like a thought running through an assembly line just to ensure it is perfect at the end.

Oh yes, this assembly line shouldn't be mistaken as Mob Mentality or as we say "Bhed Chaal" in Hindi.

Let me show you how this assembly line looks like.

> Teaching/Conversation ⇒ Questions ⇒ Practice ⇒ Doubts ⇒ Test

You must be wondering this the same thing which even we've been doing since ages and our grandparents did in their times.

Absolutely correct, this methodology of teaching has been around since Taxila and Nanda University as well. But, one factor that we miss out today is the purpose of learning.

We've stopped asking this "why" are we learning a topic. If it is a triangle, what will that do to me in my day to day life? or how will photosynthesis help me in breath better?

This mentality is somewhere diluted and there are only a few students and teachers who are able to keep this conversation going.

As the famous French poet Voltaire said in 18th century-

> "Judge of a man by his questions rather than by his answers"

and these are the people who has curiosity and ask "Why" tend to have an edge over others, and those are the teachers who generate this curiosity become those unforgettable one's.

So, it's never late to as "WHY" and find an answer. That is Education.
