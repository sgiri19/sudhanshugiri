# Scaling Agile Without Losing the Magic

Scaling agility is one of the most significant challenges in modern program management. Most frameworks (SAFe, LeSS, etc.) solve for coordination but often destroy the very autonomy that makes agile work.

## The Coordination Tax

As organizations grow, the "coordination tax" increases exponentially. Every new team requires more communication overhead.

### Strategies for Success

- **Loose Coupling, Tight Alignment**: Teams should have clear boundaries and APIs between their work.
- **Metric-Driven Clarity**: Use outcomes (North Star metrics) rather than outputs to align teams.
- **Sync, Don't Stink**: Coordination meetings should be for resolving dependencies, not for status reporting.
