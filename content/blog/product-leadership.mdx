# Product Leadership: Beyond Features and Roadmaps

Product leadership is often misunderstood as simply managing more roadmaps or overseeing more product managers. In reality, it's a fundamental shift in perspective.

## The Strategic Leap

When you transition into a leadership role, your primary output is no longer the product itself—it's the **team** that builds the product.

### Core Principles

1. **Alignment over Control**: Instead of making every decision, create a framework where the team can make the right decisions autonomously.
2. **Context, Not Content**: Provide the business context and customer pain points, then let the team find the best technical solutions.
3. **Psychological Safety**: Innovation requires the freedom to fail. Lead by example in vulnerability.

> "A leader's job is not to have all the ideas; it's to make sure all the ideas migrate to the best outcome."

## Conclusion

Leading product teams is more about coaching and cultivation than it is about command and control.
